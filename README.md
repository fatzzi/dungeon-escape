# dungeon-escape
Dungeon Escape is a text-based adventure game written in C++ that utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Players navigate a dungeon, solving  challenges and battling enemies to escape. The game implements linked lists for room navigation, queues for enemy encounters, and stacks for backtracking mechanics. The game may roast you a bit; just know its nothing personal!
